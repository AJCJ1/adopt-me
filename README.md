This is an app built with React.js using V8 react.

It integrates:

Async functions, Hooks, API integration and a number of functional components among more.

The app allows you to search for pets üêà, by using an API call. It then displays those to the user.

Do bare in mind I have pushed directly to master ONLY because it is a small personal project to get me up to scratch with React.JS.

It is also littered with comments to explain what everything does and why, and has a default CSS styling because this app was made to learn more about React itself, rather than styles (hence the not very pretty UI).
