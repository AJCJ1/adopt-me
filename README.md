This is an app built with React.js, while studying the frontendMasters complete React V8 course.

The app allows you to search for pets 🐈, by using an API call. It then displays those to the user.

Do bare in mind I have pushed directly to master ONLY because it is a small personal project to get me up to scratch with React.JS.
